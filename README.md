## Description
Our website, FlashFlip, was made for anyone who wants to learn and memorize something through the use of fladhcards. Users are able to create their own custom deck of flashcards. These decks are able to be saved and revisited but cannot be edited once made. When a deck is chosen the flashcards can be flipped from front to back like regular flashcards and there is also a button that allows you to flip forward and backward through the deck.

## Completed
- Framework for Home page
- Added Logo pictures (optional if you want to use)
- basic framework for flashflip page

## Suggestion: 
  - separate CSS stylesheets for each page - better readability and organization
  - On flash-flip.html, the p tag with id=deck-title
    - is it possible to make the title of this change depending which deck the user chooses?
    - should we use a generic title for the page instead of the title of the deck?
    - possibly use literal notation in app.js then add text content to element to create a dynamic title for page

## Home Page
Has a header with links to the other pages and other parts of the home page. There is an ad for an upgraded version of FlashFlip. Under that is the section containing the form to create your own flashcards and decks. 

## Study Page
The study page has links to the home page and about us page at the top in the header. The main content of the page is the flashcards. It holds all of the decks a user creates and allows them to access them and go left and right through their decks. 

## About Us page
The about us page contains pictures of us four authors/creators of the website. We also have our bios alternating to the left and right of the the images. It also will contain all of our contact information. 

## Problem Domain
Children and adults alike have used multiple ways to try and learn something new whether it be a new skill or a new fact. The want or need to increase one's own knowledge is something that has been essential to human growth. To grow we must learn and one way to accomplish that is through repetition. 

FlashFlip was created to be able to serve students or anyone that wants to learn anything. Flashcards have been a tactic people have used to study and learn something new and it has proven quite efficient. FlashFlip rides off of this tactic and allows anyone to create their own flashcard decks with easy navigation. 

By being a startup and providing this service to our users it is possible through future growth and time to eventually be able to diversify into other areas not unlike Quizlet. For now we will gauge the company's life and outcome through our initial results with flashcards.
