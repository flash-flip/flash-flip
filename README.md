## Completed
- Framework for Home page
- Added Logo pictures (optional if you want to use)
- basic framework for flashflip page

## Suggestion: 
  - separate CSS stylesheets for each page - better readability and organization
  - On flash-flip.html, the p tag with id=deck-title
    - is it possible to make the title of this change depending which deck the user chooses?
    - should we use a generic title for the page instead of the title of the deck?
    - possibly use literal notation in app.js then add text content to element to create a dynamic title for page
