## Description

Our website, FlashFlip, was made for anyone who wants to learn and memorize something through the use of flashcards. Users are able to create their own custom deck of flashcards. These decks are able to be saved and revisited but cannot be edited once made. When a deck is chosen the flashcards can be flipped from front to back like regular flashcards and there is also a button that allows you to flip forward and backward through the deck.

## Problem Domain

Children and adults alike have used multiple ways to try and learn something new whether it be a new skill or a new fact. The want or need to increase one's own knowledge is something that has been essential to human growth. To grow we must learn and one way to accomplish that is through repetition. 

FlashFlip was created to be able to serve students or anyone that wants to learn anything. Flashcards have been a tactic people have used to study and learn something new and it has proven quite efficient. FlashFlip rides off of this tactic and allows anyone to create their own flashcard decks with easy navigation. 

By being a startup and providing this service to our users it is possible through future growth and time to eventually be able to diversify into other areas not unlike Quizlet. For now we will gauge the company's life and outcome through our initial results with flashcards.
